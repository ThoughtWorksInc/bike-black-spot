				<h2>WHY WAS THIS APP MADE?</h2>
				<p>The Australian Greens have repeatedly requested that cycling receive federal transport funding. Last year, we made a budget submission for $80 million, however this was rejected by the government.
				The National Cycling Strategy, agreed to by State and Federal Governments, set a target to double the rate of cycling by 2016, with no funding attached. Meanwhile the Victorian government has slashed its cycling budget and WA is barely catching up to the funding levels that existed in the mid 1990s.
				We want to change that and will make the case using for substantial and sustained funding for cycling the Bike Blackspot campaign.
				Cyclists around Australia who are fed up with being endangered, ignored and neglected by Governments are invited to share your experiences of our nation’s bike blackspots and help us to make the case for why cycling funding is urgently needed.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>WHO DOES THE DATA GET SENT TO?</h2>
				<p>Your feedback is sent to your state transport minister, the federal transport minister and Senator Scott Ludlam plus the Greens transport spokesperson for your state. Your report is also logged on the bike blackspot map and will be used to make the case for better bike funding.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>WHAT WILL THE DATA BE USED FOR?</h2>
				<p>The information collected will be used to lobby for serious funding for cycling infrastructure to build a better bike network.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE AN IPHONE?</h2>
				<p>If you don’t have an iPhone, simply email your feedback with the location and a photo of the blackspot to Senator.Rice@aph.gov.au.</p>
